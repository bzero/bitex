<br><br>
<b>Last Revised: [5/2/2014]</b>
<br><br><br>
This BitEx Cloud Platform License Agreement (the "Agreement") is made and entered into by and between BitEx and the business entity agreeing to these terms ("Customer").

If you are accepting on behalf of Customer, you represent and warrant that: (i) you have full legal authority to bind Customer to this Agreement; (ii) you have read and understand this Agreement; and (iii) you agree, on behalf of Customer, to this Agreement.  If you do not have the legal authority to bind Customer, please do not click the "I Accept" button below.  This Agreement governs Customer's access to and use of the Service.

<br><br>
<b>1. Licenses.</b>
<br><br>
1.1 From BitEx to Customer. Subject to this Agreement, BitEx grants to Customer a worldwide, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, non-exclusive, terminable, limited license during the License Term to: (a) use the Services, (b) integrate the Services into any Application and provide the Services, solely as integrated into the Application, to users of the Application, and (c) use any Software provided by BitEx as part of the Services.
<br><br>
1.2 From Customer to BitEx. By submitting, posting, generating, or displaying any Application and/or Customer Data on or through the Services, Customer gives BitEx a worldwide, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, non-exclusive, terminable, limited license to use any Application and/or Customer Data for the sole purpose of enabling BitEx to provide, maintain, protect, and improve the Services in accordance with the Agreement.
<br><br>
<b>2. Provision of the Services.</b>
<br><br>
2.1 Console. BitEx will provide the Services to Customer. As part of receiving the Services Customer will have access to the Admin Console, through which Customer may administer the Services.
<br><br>
2.2 Facilities and Data Transfer. All facilities used to store and process an Application and Customer Data will adhere to reasonable security standards no less protective than the security standards at facilities where BitEx processes and stores its own information of a similar type. BitEx has implemented at least industry standard systems and procedures to ensure the security and confidentiality of an Application and Customer Data, protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of an Application and Customer Data, and protect against unauthorized access to or use of an Application and Customer Data. BitEx may process and store an Application and Customer Data in the United States or any other country in which BitEx or its agents maintain facilities.  By using the Services, Customer consents to this processing and storage of an Application and Customer Data. The parties agree that BitEx is merely a data processor.
<br><br>
2.3 Accounts. Customer must have an Account and a Token (if applicable) to use the Services, and is responsible for the information it provides to create the Account, the security of the Token and its passwords for the Account, and for any use of its Account and the Token. If Customer becomes aware of any unauthorized use of its password, its Account or the Token, Customer will notify BitEx as promptly as possible.
<br><br>
2.4 Privacy Policies.  The Services are subject to BitEx’s Privacy Policy. Changes to the Privacy Policy will be made as stated in the applicable policy.
<br><br>
2.5 New Applications and Services. BitEx may: (i) make new applications, tools, features or functionality available from time to time through the Services and (ii) add new services to the "Services" definition from time to time (by adding them at the URL set forth under that definition), the use of which may be contingent upon Customer’s agreement to additional terms.
<br><br>
2.6 Modifications.</b>
<br><br>
a. To the Services. Subject to Section 9.4 (Termination for Convenience), BitEx may make commercially reasonable Updates to the Services from time to time. If BitEx makes a material change to the Services, BitEx will inform Customer, provided that Customer has subscribed with BitEx to be informed about such change.
<br><br>
b. To the Agreement. BitEx may make changes to this Agreement, including pricing from time to time. Unless otherwise noted by BitEx, material changes to the Agreement will become effective 30 days after they are posted, except if the changes apply to new functionality in which case they will be effective immediately. If Customer does not agree to the revised Agreement, please stop using the Services. BitEx will post any modification to this Agreement to the Terms URL.
<br><br>
c. Service Specific Terms. The Service Specific Terms are hereby incorporated by reference into the Agreement.
<br><br>
<b>3. Payment Terms.</b>
<br><br>
3.1 Free Quota. Certain Services are provided to Customer without charge up to the Fee Threshold, as applicable.
<br><br>
3.2 Online Billing. BitEx will issue an electronic bill to Customer for all charges accrued above the Fee Threshold based on (i) Customer’s use of the Services during the License Term (including, if any, the relevant Fee for TSS set forth in the Fees definition below); (ii) any Reserved Units selected; (iii) any Committed Purchases selected; and/or (iv) any Package Purchases selected. For use above the Fee Threshold, Customer will be responsible for all Fees up to the amount set in the Account and will pay all Fees in U.S. Dollars or in such other currency as agreed to in writing by the parties. Customer will pay all Fees in accordance with the payment terms applicable to the Fees. BitEx's measurement of Customer’s use of the Services is final.
<br><br>
3.3 Taxes. Customer is responsible for any Taxes, and Customer will pay BitEx for the Services without any reduction for Taxes.  If BitEx is obligated to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes will be invoiced to Customer, unless Customer provides BitEx with a timely and valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. In some states the sales tax is due on the total purchase price at the time of sale and must be invoiced and collected at the time of the sale.  If Customer is required by law to withhold any Taxes from its payments to BitEx, Customer must provide BitEx with an official tax receipt or other appropriate documentation to support such withholding.
<br><br>
3.4 Invoice Disputes & Refunds. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Customer waives all claims relating to Fees unless claimed within sixty days after charged (this does not affect any Customer rights with its credit card issuer). Refunds (if any) are at the discretion of BitEx and will only be in the form of credit for the Services. Nothing in this Agreement obligates BitEx to extend credit to any party.
<br><br>
3.5 Delinquent Payments. Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less). BitEx reserves the right to suspend Customer’s Account for any late payments.
<br><br>
<b>4. Customer Obligations.</b>
<br><br>
4.1 Compliance. Customer is solely responsible for its Applications, Projects, and Customer Data and for making sure its Applications, Projects, and Customer Data comply with the Acceptable Use Policy. BitEx reserves the right to review the Application, Project, and Customer Data to ensure Customer’s compliance with the Acceptable Use Policy. Customer is responsible for ensuring all End Users comply with Customer’s obligations under the Agreement.
<br><br>
4.2 Privacy. Customer will protect the privacy and legal rights of its End Users under all applicable laws and regulations, which includes a legally adequate privacy notice communicated from Customer. Customer may have the ability to access, monitor, use, or disclose Customer Data submitted by End Users through the Services. Customer will obtain and maintain any required consents from End Users to allow Customer’s access, monitoring, use and disclosure of Customer Data. Further, Customer will notify its End Users that any Customer Data provided as part of the Services will be made available to a third party (i.e. BitEx) as part of BitEx providing the Services.
<br><br>
4.3 Restrictions. Customer will not, and will not allow third parties under its control to: (a) copy, modify, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, decompile, translate, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to extract the source code of the Services or any component thereof (subject to Section 4.4 below and except to the extent such restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law); (b) use the Services for High Risk Activities; (c) sublicense, resell, or distribute the Services or any component thereof separate from any integrated Application; (d) use the Services to create, train, or improve (directly or indirectly) a substantially similar product or service, including any other machine translation engine; (e) create multiple Applications, Accounts, or Projects to simulate or act as a single Application, Account, or Project (respectively) or otherwise access the Services in a manner intended to avoid incurring Fees; (f) unless otherwise set forth in the Service Specific Terms, use the Services to operate or enable any telecommunications service or in connection with any Application that allows End Users to place calls or to receive calls from any public switched telephone network; or (g) process or store any Customer Data that is subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations maintained by the Department of State. Unless otherwise specified in writing by BitEx, BitEx does not intend uses of the Services to create obligations under HIPAA, and makes no representations that the Services satisfy HIPAA requirements. If Customer is (or becomes) a Covered Entity or Business Associate, as defined in HIPAA, Customer agrees not to use the Services for any purpose or in any manner involving Protected Health Information (as defined in HIPAA) unless Customer has received prior written consent to such use from BitEx.
<br><br>
4.4 Third Party Components. Third party components (which may include open source software) of the Services may be subject to separate license agreements. To the limited extent a third party license expressly supersedes this Agreement, that third party license instead governs Customer’s agreement with BitEx for the specific included third party components of the Services, or use of the Services (as may be applicable).
<br><br>
4.5 Documentation. BitEx may provide Documentation for Customer’s use of the Services. The Documentation may specify restrictions (e.g. attribution or HTML restrictions) on how the Applications may be built or the Services may be used and Customer will comply with any such restrictions specified.
<br><br>
4.6 Application and No Multiple Accounts, Bills, Tokens. Any Application must have material value independent from the Services. BitEx has no obligation to provide multiple bills, Tokens (if applicable), or Accounts to Customer under the Agreement.
<br><br>
<b>5. Suspension and Removals.</b>
<br><br>
5.1 Suspension/Removals. If Customer becomes aware that any Application, Project (including an End User’s use of a Project), or Customer Data violates the Acceptable Use Policy, Customer will immediately suspend the Application or Project (if applicable), remove the applicable Customer Data or suspend access to an End User (as may be applicable). If Customer fails to suspend or remove as noted in the prior sentence, BitEx may specifically request that Customer do so. If Customer fails to comply with BitEx’s request to do so within twenty-four hours, then BitEx may suspend BitEx accounts of the applicable End Users, disable the Project or Application, and/or disable the Account (as may be applicable) until such violation is corrected.
<br><br>
5.2 Emergency Security Issues. Despite the foregoing, if there is an Emergency Security Issue, then BitEx may automatically suspend the offending End User account, Application, Project, or the Account. Suspension will be to the minimum extent required, and of the minimum duration, to prevent or terminate the Emergency Security Issue.  If BitEx suspends an End User account, Application, Project, or the Account, for any reason, without prior notice to Customer, at Customer’s request, BitEx will provide Customer the reason for the suspension as soon as is reasonably possible.
<br><br>
<b>6. Intellectual Property Rights; Brand Features.</b>
<br><br>
6.1 Intellectual Property Rights.  Except as expressly set forth herein, this Agreement does not grant either party any rights, implied or otherwise, to the other’s content or any of the other’s intellectual property. As between the parties, Customer owns all Intellectual Property Rights in Customer Data and the Application or Project (if applicable) and BitEx owns all Intellectual Property Rights in the Services and Software.
<br><br>
6.2 Brand Features Limitation.  If Customer wants to display BitEx Brand Features in connection with its use of the Services, Customer must obtain written permission from BitEx through the process specified in the Trademark Guidelines. For the purpose of providing the Services, Customer permits BitEx to display any Customer Brand Features that may appear in Customer’s use of the Services. Any use of a party’s Brand Features will inure to the benefit of the party holding Intellectual Property Rights to those Brand Features. A party may revoke the other party’s right to use its Brand Features pursuant to this Agreement with written notice to the other and a reasonable period to stop the use.
<br><br>
6.3 Customer Feedback. If Customer provides BitEx feedback or suggestions about the Services, then BitEx may use that information without obligation to Customer, and Customer hereby irrevocably assigns to BitEx all right, title, and interest in that feedback or those suggestions.

<br><br>
7.3 Deprecation Policy. BitEx will announce if it intends to discontinue or make backwards incompatible changes to the Services specified at the URL in the next sentence. BitEx will use commercially reasonable efforts to continue to operate those Services versions and features identified at https://developers.BitEx.com/cloud/terms/deprecation without these changes for at least one year after that announcement (or in the case of BitEx App Engine, until the later of: one year after that announcement or April 20, 2015), unless (as BitEx determines in its reasonable good faith judgment):

<br><br>
(ii) doing so could create a security risk or substantial economic or material technical burden.
<br><br>

<b>8. Confidential Information.</b> The recipient will not disclose the Confidential Information, except to Affiliates, employees, agents or professional advisors who need to know it and who have agreed in writing (or in the case of professional advisors are otherwise bound) to keep it confidential. The recipient will ensure that those people and entities use the received Confidential Information only to exercise rights and fulfill obligations under this Agreement, while using reasonable care to keep it confidential.  The recipient may also disclose Confidential Information to the extent required by applicable Legal Process; provided that the recipient uses commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) promptly notify the other party of such disclosure before disclosing; and (ii) comply with the other party’s reasonable requests regarding its efforts to oppose the disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subsections (i) and (ii) above will not apply if the recipient determines that complying with (i) and (ii) could: (a) result in a violation of Legal Process; (b) obstruct a governmental investigation; and/or (c) lead to death or serious physical harm to an individual.
